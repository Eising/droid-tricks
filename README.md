### Using mixers to add selects to your LEDs and possibly other things.
This snippet is not very useful from the blue-3 version, but included if someone
is still on an older version and need this functionality.

It allows you to implement `select` for things that do not support it.

## General
### Single button mute with clocked un‐mute a la algoquencer
Low on buttons and want the `[algoquencer]`'s timesynced unmute behavior?

This snippet does the same, but with a single button, and works with `selects` as well.

##### Firmware requirements
This patch requires at least `blue-3` to run on your DROID setup.

To use with droid versions older than blue-3, you have to use a mixer to manage
your LED.
